# Law of Large Numbers Simulation
This is a Python project that simulates the Law of Large Numbers by generating a large number of random values and calculating their mean. The simulation shows how the mean of a large number of random values tends to approach a fixed value as the number of values increases, illustrating the Law of Large Numbers.

# Getting Started
# Prerequisites
To run this project, you will need to have Python 3 and the following libraries installed:
```
  numpy
  matplotlib
```
You can install the libraries using the following command:
  ```
  pip install numpy matplotlib
  ```
# Installing
To install this project, you can clone this Git repository using the following command:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/gramixule/TheLawOfLargeNumbers.git
  ```
# Usage
To run the simulation, simply run the law_of_large_numbers.py script:
  ```
  python lln.py
  ```
The script will generate a graph that shows how the mean of a large number of random values tends to approach a fixed value as the number of values increases.

You can customize the parameters of the simulation by editing the n_values, range_start, and range_end variables in the law_of_large_numbers.py script.
